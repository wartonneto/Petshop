# Petshop
My first Project using NodeJs, Express, Sequelize, Postgres

Hello there, my name is Warton and this is my first project built using Node as back-end and some Node dependencies like nodemon, express, sucrase, sequelize, pg and pg-hstore.

i hope you enjoy !

# Running

To initialize this back-end application, remember to switch the ./src/config/database.js to your postgres username and password.
After that, you only need to run 'npm run app' to start application that runs in localhost:3001.
